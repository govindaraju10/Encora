1.You have an EC2 instance that has an unencryted volume. You want to create another Encrypted volume form this unencrypted volume .which of the following steps can achieve this ? How would you share this encrypted volume to another account?
what must you ensure to make sure thus cross-account encryption is shared?
 To create an encrypted volume from an unencrypted volume, we can follow these steps:
•	Stop the EC2 instance that has the unencrypted volume.
•	Create a snapshot of the unencrypted volume.
•	Copy the snapshot and encrypt it using an available key.
•	Create a new EBS volume from the encrypted snapshot.
To share this encrypted volume with another account, we can use the following steps:
•	In the source account, create an EBS snapshot of the encrypted volume.
•	Share the snapshot with the target account.
•	In the target account, create a new EBS volume from the shared snapshot.
To ensure that cross-account encryption is shared, you must ensure that the KMS key used to encrypt the snapshot is shared with the target account. You can share a KMS key by creating a key policy that grants permissions to the target account’s IAM user or role.
 
2. How will you implement service control policy and in which area are you using it?
Service Control Policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your AWS organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization . SCPs are used to ensure that your accounts stay within your organization’s access control guidelines and help you to manage permissions in your organization .
We can implement SCPs by creating a separate Terraform configuration for each account that we want to manage. 
To create an SCP, we can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. You can define an SCP by specifying a policy that lists the actions that are allowed or denied for a set of AWS services. You can then attach the SCP to an organizational unit (OU) or an account in our organization .

3.How can you convert a public subnet to private subnet?
To convert a public subnet to a private subnet
•	Create a new route table for the private subnet.
•	Associate the new route table with the private subnet.
•	Remove the default route from the new route table.
•	Add a new route to the new route table that points to a NAT gateway or an instance in your VPC that has access to the internet.
•	Update the security group rules for your instances in the private subnet to allow outbound traffic.

4.What is the default route for any newly created route table?
By default, a newly created route table has a local route for communication within the VPC. This means that the route table can be used to route traffic between resources in the same VPC. However, it does not have a default route that can be used to route traffic to the internet or other VPCs 
5. How would you ensure routes in the route table DO NOT use the local routes?
To ensure that routes in a route table do not use the local routes, we can remove the default local route from the route table. By default, every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC . We can remove this route by creating a new route table and adding only the routes that you want to use. You can then associate the new route table with your subnets.
